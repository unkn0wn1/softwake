## Unreleased

- Natural-language sleep and hibernate while awake ask a short confirm (`Sleep now?` / `Hibernate now?`) before changing state. A clear yes applies the transition and the existing state voice. No, or 15 seconds of silence, stays awake.
- While asleep, a below-threshold wake-word near-miss (not bare `hi`) or a typed wake attempt asks `Were you trying to wake me?` at most once every 45 seconds. Yes wakes. No or silence stays asleep.
- Hard keyword hits (`hi`, the profile name, `sleep`, `deep sleep`, and the other configured phrases) stay immediate and do not ask. Fire thresholds are unchanged. The near-miss probe runs during sleep so fuzzy wake can hear those hits; it does not lower the fire threshold.
